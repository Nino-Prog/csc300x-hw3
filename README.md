## Introduction

In this project, we've created a website in the style of a blog to showcase food and drink recommendations on or close to our campus. The website includes an introduction section, recommendations for food establishments, and a meal plan feature where users can create their meal plan based on our recommendations.

## Recommendations

The recommendations section features a curated list of food establishments within a half-mile radius from Petty building. Each recommendation includes a short description, specialties, hours of operation, and specific dishes that we recommend.

## Meal Plan

The meal plan feature allows users to create their meal plan for the day based on our recommendations. Users can select dishes from the recommendations section, add them to the meal plan, and view the total cost of their selected meals. They also have the option to remove dishes or add more orders of the same dish to the meal plan.

## Usage

To use this website, simply navigate to the [live version](https://<username>.github.io/<repository>) hosted on GitHub Pages. You can explore the recommendations, select dishes for your meal plan, and view the total cost of your selected meals.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have any suggestions, feature requests, or bug reports, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's make Dine On Campus even better together.
